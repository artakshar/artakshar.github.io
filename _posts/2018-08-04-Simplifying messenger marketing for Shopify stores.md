      <h3>About Convertfly</h3>
      <p>Convertfly is a Messenger marketing app built for Shopify. Convertfly’s main target audience consisted of people
        who are not marketers but people selling stuff they craft (some do drop-shipping).</p>
    </div>

      <h3>UX Problems</h3>
      <div class="lists">
        <div class="list-item">
          <p>
            <b>Reaching the wow was a long way</b>
          </p>
          <p>The wow moment needed users to set up tedious campaigns and wait for results. Setting up campaigns was a very
            open-ended experience.</p>
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <div class="list-item">
          <p>
            <b>Making new campaign needs many decisions</b>
          </p>
          <p>Along with long forms, there was little to no education on best practices.</p>
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <div class="list-item">
          <p>
            <b>Redesigning whole experience</b>
          </p>
          <p>We built the first version, we had little understanding of a typical Shopify store owner. This resulted in a
            product which didn’t expect their level of simplicity and ease.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="process-step image-container">
    <img src="/assets/convertfly-making-messenger-marketing-simple/splash-2.png" alt="Convertfly helps Shopify stores with various widgets for recovering sales"/>
    <p><b>Older experience</b> was confusing to most of the Shopify store owners</p>
  </div>
  <!-- TARGET AUDIENCE -->
  <div class="process-step small-container">
    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
    <p>People with Shopify stores and those looking for new marketing channels. Two main goals of these users would be to,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recover abandoned carts through a channel with better open rates than email</li>
      <li>Engaging customers and selling their products in conversations</li>
      <li>Experiment with new sales and marketing channels</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <!-- USER RESEARCH -->
  <div class="process-step small-container">
    <h3>User Research</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Talked to existing customers and interested people</li>
      <li>Remotely conducted UX testing</li>
      <li>Watched user sessions on Fullstory</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
      <b>Top takeaways from the research</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shopify store owners do not have enough time for marketing. They explicitly asked for one-click solutions.</li>
      <li>They do not understand most of the marketing terminologies. Most of the Shopify store owners are not tech-savvy.</li>
      <li>They carry subtle anxiety when you ask them to connect Facebook to any other tool. Most of their business came in
        from Facebook Ads. If an app were to cause a problem with Facebook, Facebook could block their Facebook page.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="process-step small-container">
    <h3>UX Solutions</h3>
    <p>We split design solutions into three major features</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Templates or default campaigns which will reduce decisions and make it easy to get started. MailChimp, OptinMonster
        and several other marketing tools were doing this already.</li>
      <li>Work on messaging using keywords from Shopify’s guidelines, and avoiding using words from our B2B SaaS vocabulary.</li>
      <li>Adding preview interaction for each campaign. They could see how campaign looked before they enabled it or connected
        their Facebook account.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Homepage for first time user</b>: Onboarding notifications were right in the explore page where users could go check out campaigns and then wrap up the setup</p>

      <h3>Metrics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We had more users turning on more campaigns. New stores turned on first campaigns in the first session itself.</li>
        <li>In majority user recordings, we saw our users hitting preview before connecting their Facebook page. Preview allowed
          them to understand the app better and then connect if app fits in with their marketing ideas.</li>
        <li>Onboarding helped onboarding users and helped with setting up campaigns right.</li>
      </ul>
