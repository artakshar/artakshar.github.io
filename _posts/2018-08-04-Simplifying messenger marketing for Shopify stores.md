        <h3>About Convertfly</h3>
        <p>Convertfly is a Messenger marketing app built for Shopify. Convertfly’s main target audience consisted of people
          who are not marketers but people selling stuff they craft (some do drop-shipping).</p>

        <h3>UX Problems</h3>

          <div class="list-item">
            <p>
              <b>Reaching the wow was a long way</b>
            </p>
            <p>The wow moment needed users to set up tedious campaigns and wait for results. Setting up campaigns was a very
              open-ended experience.</p>
          </div>
          <div></div>
          <div class="list-item">
            <p>
              <b>Making new campaign needs many decisions</b>
            </p>
            <p>Along with long forms, there was little to no education on best practices.</p>
          </div>
          <div></div>

              <b>Redesigning whole experience</b>
            </p>
            <p>We built the first version, we had little understanding of a typical Shopify store owner. This resulted in a
              product which didn’t expect their level of simplicity and ease.</p>

    <!-- TARGET AUDIENCE -->
    <div class="process-step">
      <h3>Target Audience</h3>
      <p>People with Shopify stores and those looking for new marketing channels. Two main goals of these users would be to,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recover abandoned carts through a channel with better open rates than email</li>
        <li>Engaging customers and selling their products in conversations</li>
        <li>Experiment with new sales and marketing channels</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- USER RESEARCH -->
    <div class="process-step">
      <h3>User Research</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Talked to existing customers and interested people</li>
        <li>Remotely conducted UX testing</li>
        <li>Watched user sessions on Fullstory</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Top takeaways from the research</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shopify store owners do not have enough time for marketing. They explicitly asked for one-click solutions.</li>
        <li>They do not understand most of the marketing terminologies. Most of the Shopify store owners are not tech-savvy.</li>
        <li>They carry subtle anxiety when you ask them to connect Facebook to any other tool. Most of their business came in
          from Facebook Ads. If an app were to cause a problem with Facebook, Facebook could block their Facebook page.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>UX Solutions</h3>
      We split design solutions into three major features
      <ol>
        <li>Templates or default campaigns which will reduce decisions and make it easy to get started. MailChimp, OptinMonster
          and several other marketing tools were doing this already.</li>
        <li>Work on messaging using keywords from Shopify’s guidelines, and avoiding using words from our B2B SaaS vocabulary.</li>
        <li>Adding preview interaction for each campaign. They could see how campaign looked before they enabled it or connected
          their Facebook account.</li>
      </ol>

        <li>First decision about "Add tools" page</li>

        <h3>Metrics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We had more users implementing more campaigns. Each new store would install at least one campaign in their very
            first session.</li>
          <li>In majority user recordings, we saw our users hitting preview before connecting their Facebook page. Preview allowed
            them to understand the app better and then connect if app fits in with their marketing ideas.</li>
        </ul>
