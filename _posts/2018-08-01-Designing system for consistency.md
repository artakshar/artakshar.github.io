      <h3>About Helpshift</h3>
      <p>Helpshift enabled support teams at Microsoft, Supercell, and Tencent Games to help over 600 million users monthly. The growing number of conversations coupled with the diverse user base led us to focus our efforts on making our UX more inclusive and accessible. I was leading the design efforts for making Helpshift SDKs accessible across all platforms.</p>

      <h3>Goals of this exercise</h3>
      <p>The primary goal of this exercise was to design a system which would help bring consistency in future SDK projects.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design a system for Helpshift mobile design team</li>
        <li>Enabling customisability for new components and updating developer docs</li>
      </ul>

  <!-- UX Solution -->

    <h3>Designing a system for consistency</h3>
    <p>
    Helpshift’s design strategy was to provide native experience. This design system would start off as a style guide and then grow into a design system. The way I envisioned this to progress is,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Colours and typography</li>
      <li>UI elements and components</li>
      <li>Adding usage docs for UI elements and components</li>
      <li>Writing (starting off with tone for error messages)</li>
      <li>Interaction library</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="process-step">
    <h3>Colours and typography</h3>
    <p>Helpshift's native experience demanded the SDK to be updated with the best practices of each platform.</p>

    <p><b>Defining core user flows</b></p>
    <p>All the elements which don’t have to be part of the accessibility flow</p>

    <h3>Educating fellow designers about accessibility</h3>
    <p>Helpshift had a design team of 6 product designers. To get inclusive mindsets we had to have equal knowledge of do’s and don’ts of accessibility. I was given the responsibility of creating awareness of the need to think about accessibility and how can we do our best to be more accessible.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Conducted sessions detailing the need to focus on accessibility and what are the tools we would need to design for (Talkback and VoiceOver)</p>

  <div class="process-step">
    <h3>Establishing accessibility processes for design & engineering</h3>
    <p>The next step for accessibility efforts at Helpshift was to add accessibility practices to the design process and prepare developers for what to expect with upcoming features.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adding labels to any new UI elements you use</li>
      <li>Using text styles recommended by respective OS (used Material design and Human Interface Guidelines for most of it)</li>
      <li>A redefined colour palette for eliminating all the colours with bad contrast ratios</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Takeaways and lessons learnt</h3>
    <p>I found this project interesting for the reason there was so much to learn about peripherals of design and reading through 100 pages of documents to learn about best practices.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Things I learned</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The need for accessibility at scale</li>
      <li>The current state of accessibility tools on Android, iOS & macOS</li>
      <li>The engineering side of accessibility</li>
    </ul>
