# My (Akshar) Portfolio website 
This project was built in 2018 - 2019 and I don't update this anymore. I used Jekyll without any themes for generating static website without focusing too much on formatting.

#### About me
I am Akshar, a product designer working at <a href="https://www.gojek.io/">Gojek</a>. I am in the financial services team part of GoPay group.


#### Design process

Stage I: Research & Requirement Gathering: Research for existing design patterns in the industry and engage with customers. Construct requirement docs in collaboration with product managers.

Stage II: User flows and Wireframes: With the help of requirement docs and user insights I draw out user flows and user stories for early design discussions. Draw Balsamiq wireframes to engage engineers and stakeholders early on.

Stage III: UI Design, Prototype, and Hand-off: High fidelity mockups on Sketch. Prototypes range from Invision to HTML/CSS projects. I primarily use Zeplin for the handoff.
